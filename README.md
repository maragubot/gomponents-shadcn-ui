A Go port of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) built with [gomponents](https://www.gomponents.com/).

**Note:** This is an automated AI port. Components are generated and may require review before production use.

Following shadcn's philosophy, components are designed to be **copied into your project** rather than imported as a dependency. This gives you full ownership and customization freedom.

## Usage

Find the component you need, copy the Go code into your project. Each component is a self-contained `.go` file with minimal dependencies.

Components use CSS variables for theming (like `--primary`, `--background`, `--radius`) with Tailwind v4 classes. Set up the standard shadcn CSS variables in your project for styling to work.
